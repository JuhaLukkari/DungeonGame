# DungeonGame
Dungeon Hack'n'Slash game made in 2010. Features include, item collecting, crude AI, crude lighting effect, file reading and own filetypes for maps and items, game saving and loading, etc. Some graphics taken from Diablo (1996) by Blizzard Software, since I never planned to put this out anywhere. I remove those images if somebody is not okay with this.
